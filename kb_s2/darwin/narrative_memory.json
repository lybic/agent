  "How to search on the bilibili website": "The task was not successfully executed. The agent stopped after navigating to the Bilibili website and did not proceed to search for \"openai\".\n\n**Reasons for Failure:**\nThe agent failed to complete all the required steps of the task. While it successfully opened Safari and navigated to the Bilibili homepage, it did not perform the final, crucial step of searching for \"openai\".
