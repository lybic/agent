  "How to search on the bilibili website": "The task was not successfully executed. The agent stopped after navigating to the Bilibili website and did not proceed to search for \"openai\".\n\n**Reasons for Failure:**\nThe agent failed to complete all the required steps of the task. While it successfully opened Safari and navigated to the Bilibili homepage, it did not perform the final, crucial step of searching for \"openai\". The agent's reflection at each step incorrectly stated that the current action was not part of the initial \"Open Safari\" subtask, which may have caused it to halt prematurely instead of proceeding with the plan.\n\n**Potential Suggestions:**\n1.  After navigating to a website, verify that the plan is updated to reflect the next part of the task (e.g., searching). Do not get stuck reflecting on a previously completed subtask.\n2.  After successfully loading `www.bilibili.com`, the next action should be to locate the search bar on the webpage.\n3.  Once the search bar is identified, type \"openai\" into it and press Enter to initiate the search.",
